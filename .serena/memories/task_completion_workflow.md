# Task Completion Workflow

When a task is completed, follow these steps:

1. **Verify Functionality:** Ensure the changes work as expected in the development environment (`yarn dev`).
2. **Lint:** Run `yarn lint` to ensure no linting errors were introduced.
3. **Build:** Run `yarn build` to verify that the project builds successfully without type errors.
4. **Clean Up:** Remove any temporary files or debug logging added during development.
